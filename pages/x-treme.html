            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                X-Treme is a robot mech-suit piloted by <a href="exec.html">Exec</a>. The suit is sentient and prone to
                failure, as indicated by its evacuation feature not working. The suit is EXTREMELY well armored, with
                most units dealing no damage to the boss.
            </p>
            <p>
                The literal background contains a core, seemingly linked to the X-Treme suit as indicated by the panels
                changing per phase as well as the final phase.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="behavior">
            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>
                X-Treme shoots a plasma gun that deals damage in an AOE as well as stuns. Every few attacks, X-Treme
                will use an ability. In phase one, X-Treme alternates between a gatling gun and grenades, in that order.
                The gatling gun stuns and is likely to rip through anything in the front line that doesn't have armor.
                X-Treme's grenades roll, allowing them to hit your base from very far away. Because of this, it is
                crucial to knock X-Treme into phase two as soon as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon reaching phase two, X-Treme will lose an arm before shooting a barrage of grenades three times at
                your units. From here, X-Treme will lose the grenade ability and instead use a new ability. The new
                ability involves X-Treme targetting a random unit and striking them with a very high
                damage single-target beam. It does this three times per use. X-Treme's minigun is also upgraded to deal
                more damage. On top of this, X-Treme attacks faster.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon activation of phase three, X-Treme's head is blown off, replaced by a glowing orb. X-Treme will
                then use one last gatling barrage and begin spitting grenades out of its head in an aread around it.
                X-Treme will attack and move much faster. It's best to start praying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon defeating X-Treme the suit will detonate violently, dealing immense damage to anything around it.
                In the background, the nuclear core will pulse and a 5 minute timer will start. As one last act of
                spite, the core will blow you up if you don't manage to kill the enemy base within those 5 minutes.
            </p>
