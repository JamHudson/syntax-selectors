            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>EXEC is the assumed executive of Innovation Inc laboratories. He is fought underground in Area 51.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>EXEC is a black-traited boss. He attacks at range and stuns on hit. After enough shots, he'll input a
                code onto his tablet before activating a random ability. The nature of the attack varies depending on
                the number
                of units on the field. When at an advantage, the abilities will be support-oriented. When at a
                disadvantage, the abilities will be offense-oriented.</p>
            <p>In phase two, he'll input ":overclock" onto his tablet and teleport back to his base. He'll repeat the
                same behavior as phase one, albeit attacking faster meaning he uses his ability more.</p>
            <p>In phase three, he'll input giberrish onto his tablet before teleporting back to his base again. This
                time, his base will be moved further away from yours (an ability unique to this boss) and every unit
                will glitch. EXEC will continue using abilities, typing gibberish onto his
                device, while also speeding up once again aswell as turning red.</p>
            <p>Glitched units play random sounds, animations, and wear incorrect clothing. This is mostly a visual
                change as their behavior remains the same. Any unit spawned while EXEC is alive after this point will
                also be glitched.</p>
            <p>Upon defeating EXEC, he'll begin glitching himself, teleporting randomly around the arena. This last a
                second before EXEC vanishes completely.</p>
