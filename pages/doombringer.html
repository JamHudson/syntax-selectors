            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Doombringer is the assumed guardian of the Doomspires. Considering his weapon, the "Banhammer",
                Doombringer is likely a force against the unruly and guilty. The implications of such an individual
                being the player's first opponent lends credence to the belief that the player is not morally correct.
            </p>

        <section id="behavior">
            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>Doombringer is slow moving and needs range. He'll walk forward with his hammer and smash the ground when
                in range of a unit. After enough swings, he'll charge up his hammer before swinging a devastating blow,
                ignoring knockback immune units. After another set of hammer swings, he'll reach to the sky before
                equipping all of his current allies with bucket helmets, increasing their defense.</p>
