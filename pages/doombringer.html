            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Doombringer is the assumed guardian of the Doomspires. Considering his weapon, the "Banhammer",
                Doombringer is likely a force against the unruly and guilty. The implications of such an individual
                being the player's first opponent lends credence to the belief that the player is not morally correct.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="behavior">
            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>Doombringer is slow moving but well defended boss. He relies upon massive AOE and incredible burst-damage
                to rip away your front-line. Doombringer is especially dependent on his units to push forward.</p>
            <p>In his first phase, Doombringer will slowly walk forward until in range of a unit. When in range,
                Doombringer smashes his hammer onto the ground, dealing large damage in a large AOE. After enough hits
                with his hammer, he uses a charged hammer swing, dealing super knockback and dealing devestating damage.
                He'll repeat his swings an equal amount of times before using another ability, he'll reach to the sky
                and buff all of his allies, granting them armor.</p>
            <p>In phase two, which is about 20% of his health remaining, Doombringer will charge-up a massive hammer
                smash. The attack creates shockwaves which will most definietely reach your backline. In the process, he
                loses his helmet and armor. Doombringer will start screaming. In phase two Doombringer moves and attack
                much faster.</p>
            <p>Upon being defeated, he lets out a final scream of anger, his head turning into a black skull. He'll then
                fall over to the ground.</p>
