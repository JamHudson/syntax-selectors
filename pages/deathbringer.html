            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The charred, yet still living body of <a href="doombringer.html">Doombringer</a>. Intent on revenge
                rather than justice.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>Deathbringer will punch you, sacrifice his own units to deal more damage to you, and go into a berserk
                rage each phase to rush your base and obliterate you. On top of this, he is much faster than his old
                form.</p>
            <p>In his first phase, he will simply walk towards your units and punch them, similar to his normal form
                final phase.</p>
            <p>Upon activating his second phase, he will kill all of his allies. For each unit killed, he will gain more
                damage. Deathbringer's attacks also change to a three-hit combo, the last hit reaching further and
                dealing more damage.</p>
            <p>Once reaching a very low amount of health, Deathbringer will be knocked away and over. After a short
                delay, he'll rise to his feet spouting rage induced gibberish. He'll then begin spinning and rapidly
                approaching your base. Each spin will deal damage in a large area to any unit in his range.</p>
            <p>Upon being defeated, Deathbringer will let out an even more rage-filled scream, fully disintegrating in
                the process.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>Deathbringer is an oppressive boss, especially early game. Deathbringer's absurd damage (especially in
                3-star difficulty) invalidates the use of most meatshields aside from Retro/Atari, or cheap spam units
                like Battler.</p>
            <p>The most important part of this level is stalling Deathbringer long enough to begin spamming Retro
                battler. The best way to do this is spawning normal Battlers while upgrading bank and gathering Tix
                Collectors.</p>
            <p>The first issue you'll run into is the beginning wave of units. They are best dealt with by grouping them
                together and killing them all at once with the Slammer Cannon.</p>
